# Event QR Gallery
Event QR Gallery is an open-source tool that turns QR codes into **interactive experiences for events**.
The QR Code Photo Sharing Platform, is for any event wether its weddings, family gatherings or corporate use. 

With this, you can easly make interactive slideshows for a TV and allow guests uploading pictures at the event. 
Each visitor will get access to a event webapp through a QR code, where they can upload images, controlling the TV at the event (swiping through pictures, selecting categories etc). 
There are also a app builder, where you can build your own web app for the event. And adding apps like controlling slideshows to uploading images and accessing custom event apps like program, guestbook etc.

I was tired of the same old QR gallery systems, that doesn't allow you to own your own data - so i created this for a family gathering. 

I hope this project makes it easy for attendees to get involved.
